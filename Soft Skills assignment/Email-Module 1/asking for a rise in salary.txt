Subject: Request for Salary Adjustment
Dear Manager,
I hope youâ€™re doing well. I wanted to take a moment to discuss my current compensation and request a salary adjustment 
based on my performance and contributions in my role.Over the past 2 years, I have consistently achieved and exceeded all my sales targets, this accomplishment has not only 
contributed to the company's revenue growth but have also strengthened our relationships with key clients and improved our market positioning.
Additionally, I have taken on responsibility as a team leader and guided my sales team to achieve our goal. I believe these contributions,
along with the current market trends for sales professionals in our industry, justify a review of my compensation.
I am very passionate about my work here and am committed to driving even greater results for the company. 
I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss this matter further at a time that is convenient for you.
Thank you for your time and understanding. I look forward to your feedback.
Best regards,
Bhavik Parmar

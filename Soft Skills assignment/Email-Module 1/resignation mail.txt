Subject: Resignation – Bhavik Parmar
Dear Manager,
I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to formally resign from my position as a sales TL from this company.
This decision was not easy, as I have greatly valued my time at this company. I’ve worked alongside such a talented team have been incredibly rewarding.
However, after careful consideration, I have decided to pursue another opportunity to make a way for my personal growth.
Please let me know how I can assist during this transition period to ensure a smooth handover of my responsibilities.
 I am happy to help train a replacement or complete any outstanding tasks to the best of my ability.
Thank you for your guidance and support during my time. I truly appreciate the experience and knowledge I’ve gained here, 
and I hope to stay in touch in the future.
Wishing you and the team continued success.
Best regards,
Bhavik Parmar
